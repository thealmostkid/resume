\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}
I love writing good software.  Good software of course means software that works
as the customer desires.  It should be obvious to use and free from bugs
(ideally!).  Such a goal demands testing of all varities: static code analysis,
unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing.  Such a vision also
demands forethought, planning and clear communication between customer and
developer (requirements) and between developers themselves (design planning).
These are all practices I strive to improve in my won work.  These are also all
practices I have sought to establish throughout our company.

Good software is also art.  Constructing code is a craft.  I experience a thrill
when I see the different parts of a system and how they fit together.  Finding
the patterns to bring the pieces into a logical, clean, unified whole.  To have
code that is easy to read (naming, style, conventions), easy to understand
(isolated, simple, logical) and easy to modify (structured, encapsulated,
designed) is ultimately satisfying.  I love thinking about software architecture
and refactoring.

A craftsman who enjoys his work benefits everyone.  Customers benefit when
developers are passionate about their code.  Better software is written.  The
development team benefits when a craftsman contributes well-thought-out product
with maintenance in mind.  The company benefits when a craftsman works
efficiently and successfully.

I think I personally would benefit working at your company for some reasons...

Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
