\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}
My ambitions can best be characterized as a passionate software
engineer.  Such a person is a modern-day craftsman.  He blends logic
and art to produce functional and beautiful wares.  The impact is
widespread.  Customers benefit because software is easier to use
and more stable.  Co-developers benefit from better design, simpler
integration and reduced maintenance.  The employer benefits from
improved efficiency, shorter development cycles and higher morale.
To truly excel, a software craftsman must have technical expertise,
passion for the craft and a desire to continually refine and improve.

In all these things I have strenuously applied myself to become an
excellent software craftsman.  My technical expertise was founded
during my undergraduate and doctoral studies at Brown University
and University of Illinois respectively, where I focused on mobile
computing and distributed systems.  In addition, six years in
industry have built the skills necessary for daily code construction.

I have a passion for creating code that is simple, encapsulated and
logical.  I write code to be read and hopefully enjoyed, relying
on good naming and adherence to conventions.  I love refactoring
and (re-)architecting software to eliminate waste, improve performance
and ease modification.  When designing software I experience a
thrill in identifying the different parts of a system and fitting
each piece together.

I have been driven by my my passion for great software to constantly
learn new technologies and improve my work style.  A desire for
constant refactoring drove me to teach myself test-driven development
practices and adopt automated testing and static code analysis in
my own projects.  Over the last few years I have taught and championed
these techniques within my team and been rewarded with opportunities
to manage small teams of developers and lead several features through
their development life-cycle.  During these experiences I have honed
my ability to clearly communicate requirements and design and
also increased my reliance on design patterns and coding standards.
My efforts have been well-rewarded through multiple promotions and
the satisfaction of our company Bytemobile being purchased by Citrix
Systems in 2012.

Due to my background in Distributed Systems and Networking I am
well-positioned to solve the sort of problems Bandwidth tackles on
a regular basis.  I have experience working with Internet media and
communications systems.  I have nearly 13 years history programming
in Java, including two years working in the Java group at Sun
Microsystems.  Through study, application and teaching I have built
a solid expertise in object-oriented software design and software
construction in general that I would love to integrate with the
Bandwidth team.  My passion for crafting great products combined
with a history of analysis, critical thinking and intentionality
make me well-suited to the Senior Developer role.

Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
