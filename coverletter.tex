\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}
My ambitions can best be characterized as a passionate software
engineer.  Such a person is a modern-day craftsman.  He blends logic
and art to produce functional and beautiful wares.  The impact is
widespread.  Customers benefit because software is easier to use
and more stable.  Co-developers benefit from better design, simpler
integration and reduced maintenance.  The employer benefits from
improved efficiency, shorter development cycles and higher morale.
To truly excel, a software craftsman must have technical expertise,
passion for the craft and a desire to continually refine and improve.

In all these things I have strenuously applied myself to become an
excellent software craftsman.  My technical expertise was founded
during my undergraduate and doctoral studies at Brown University
and University of Illinois respectively, where I focused on mobile
computing and distributed systems.  In addition, six years in
industry have built the skills necessary for daily code construction.

I have a passion for creating code that is simple, encapsulated and
logical.  I write code to be read and hopefully enjoyed, relying
on good naming and adherence to conventions.  I love refactoring
and (re-)architecting software to eliminate waste, improve performance
and ease modification.  When designing software I experience a
thrill in identifying the different parts of a system and fitting
each piece together.

I have been driven by my my passion for great software to constantly
learn new technologies and improve my work style.  A desire for
constant refactoring drove me to teach myself test-driven development
practices and adopt automated testing and static code analysis in
my own projects.  Over the last few years I have taught and championed
these techniques within my team and been rewarded with opportunities
to manage small teams of developers and lead several features through
their development life-cycle.  During these experiences I have honed
my ability to clearly communicate requirements and design and
also increased my reliance on design patterns and coding standards.
My efforts have been well-rewarded through multiple promotions and
the satisfaction of our company Bytemobile being purchased by Citrix
Systems in 2012.

I believe my skills in software design and software construction
would be a great asset to the Salesforce.com team.  Java was my
first programming language and the majority of my programming in
the 17 years since has been in Java, including two years working
in the Java team at Sun Microsystems.  My expertise in class design,
design patterns and modern agile programming techniques will serve
to grow the code base into an even stronger platform.  Having studied
and worked with distributed systems, networking technologies, and
UNIX system programming for 11 years I am well-prepared to innovate
within the Salesforce.com platform.  Personally I would be excited
to join Salesforce.com to help define the future of the Cloud.

Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
