\section{Overview}
My research focuses on the areas of mobile systems and wireless
networking as well as distributed computing and the Internet.
My objective is to apply my expertise in these areas to develop and deploy new
software systems that improve end-user communication and expand it in new
directions.
\fi

%My research is targeted at the unique systems problems found in the deployment
%of end-user created wireless networks.  Such networks are becoming increasingly
%common due the high availability of wireless networking components and
%include, for example, open
%Wi-Fi access points, social ad-hoc networks and disruption-tolerant
%opportunistic networks.
%My work focuses on improving the availability,
%accessibility and performance of these networks by creating new local and
%distributed protocols
%and algorithms and providing real world implementations that inter-operate with
%existing systems.  
%I also have two years industry experience debugging Sun's Java implementation
%and interacting with external developers.

%day-after networks - networks formed with limited or unavailable access to the
%core Internet infrastructure.
%\end{inmargins}
% TODO: make this project: challenges: solutions
\begin{packed_item}
\item
Designed and simulated a congestion control protocol for delay-tolerant networks
that locally adjusts the
per-encounter replication limit based on measured network conditions.  
\item
Created a
stochastic model of message delivery in delay-tolerant networks that inspired
the design of our congestion detection mechanism.
\item
Evaluated in simulators OMNET++ and ONE (C++/Java) with bash and perl scripts.

%The Authentication on the Edge (AGE) project describes a new authentication
%architecture for global scale open Wi-Fi networks.
%A new paradigm for providing outdoor broadband access is emerging
%in which private entities (small businesses or residential users) open their
%private Wi-Fi access points to nearby users in exchange for access privileges at
%other users' locations.  In order for these open Wi-Fi networks to gain wide
%adoption strict access control and traceability are needed.  AGE localizes
%authentications to the edge of the network by requiring each user to carry all
%of his authentication credentials.  AGE supports a social network overlay as a
%fall back mechanism to relieve the bottleneck and single failure point of a
%central authentication server.
%\end{inmargins}
\begin{packed_item}
\item
Co-created Authentication on the Edge (AGE) procedure for
authentication in open Wi-Fi networks
with millions of mobile clients which demand strict access control and
traceability.
\item

and a social network overlay fall-back mechanism.
\item
Implemented AGE modules for FreeRADIUS and wpa\_supplicant for Linux in C.
