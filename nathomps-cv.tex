\section{Overview}
My research focuses on the areas of mobile systems and wireless
networking as well as distributed computing and the Internet.
My objective is to apply my expertise in these areas to develop and deploy new
software systems that improve end-user communication and expand it in new
directions.
\fi

%My research is targeted at the unique systems problems found in the deployment
%of end-user created wireless networks.  Such networks are becoming increasingly
%common due the high availability of wireless networking components and
%include, for example, open
%Wi-Fi access points, social ad-hoc networks and disruption-tolerant
%opportunistic networks.
%My work focuses on improving the availability,
%accessibility and performance of these networks by creating new local and
%distributed protocols
%and algorithms and providing real world implementations that inter-operate with
%existing systems.  
%I also have two years industry experience debugging Sun's Java implementation
%and interacting with external developers.

%day-after networks - networks formed with limited or unavailable access to the
%core Internet infrastructure.
%\end{inmargins}
% TODO: make this project: challenges: solutions
\begin{packed_item}
\item
Research focus on creating protocols and software to enable sharing of idle
network resources by end-users in dynamic mobile-computing environments.
\item
Developed a congestion control protocol for intermittenly-connected networks
that improves message delivery by between 15\% and 73\% in extreme cases. 
Results are based on simulation and modeling.
\item
Created a location-based data overlay for vehicular networks which uses location
history to control data-packet routing decisions improving data query rate by
300\% - 600\% compared to traditional mechanisms.  Vehicular-network simulation
based on real urban topologies was used to perform protocol analysis.
\item
Designed a Wi-Fi authentication scheme for mobile clients based on end-user
social connections that improves resiliency and reduces authentication delays
by up to 50\% in residential settings.  Evaluated using network traces from a
large ISP and testbed deployment.
\item
Implemented a software system for Practical End-host Residential Multihoming
which enables access to multiple Wi-Fi access points to reduce network latency
by up to 15\% for short-duration flows and can improve download times by
28\%-62\% for longer-lived sessions.  Results from testbed based on OpenWRT
Linux router.

%\begin{inmargins}{0.25in}
%The Authentication on the Edge (AGE) project describes a new authentication
%architecture for global scale open Wi-Fi networks.
%A new paradigm for providing outdoor broadband access is emerging
%in which private entities (small businesses or residential users) open their
%private Wi-Fi access points to nearby users in exchange for access privileges at
%other users' locations.  In order for these open Wi-Fi networks to gain wide
%adoption strict access control and traceability are needed.  AGE localizes
%authentications to the edge of the network by requiring each user to carry all
%of his authentication credentials.  AGE supports a social network overlay as a
%fall back mechanism to relieve the bottleneck and single failure point of a
%central authentication server.
%\end{inmargins}
\begin{packed_item}

Analyzed SMS traces to inform design of end-user-based authentication for
shared Wi-Fi networks which was implemented
for FreeRADIUS and wpa\_supplicant for Linux.

%%The DPRG group studies design, implementation, and

%Our design methodology for distributed protocols identifies multiple building
%blocks which compose many probabilistic protocols previously developed.  The
%methodology also specifies the composition rules by which the building blocks
%are combined into complete protocols.  The Proactive Protocol Composition
%Language is used to specify new protocols from existing C code based on this
%methodology.

\begin{packed_item}

multiple building blocks which compose many probabilistic protocols previously
